# Elevate Labs Task 5: Packet Capture and Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains deliverables for Day 5 of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship (June 30, 2025). The task involves capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark to identify protocols.

## Task Details
- **Objective**: Capture packets, identify at least three protocols, and export as `.pcap`.
- **Tool Used**: Wireshark on Ubuntu.
- **Interface**: `wlp1s0`
- **Deliverables**:
  - `packet_analysis_report.md`: Report of protocols and findings.
  - `wireshark_capture.pcap`: Packet capture file.
  - `screenshots/wireshark_filters.png`: Screenshots of filtered packets.
  - `notes.md`: Wireshark setup commands.

## Findings
- Protocols: DNS, ICMP.
- DNS: Queries for `cursor.com`, `google.com`.
- ICMP: Ping to `google.com`.

## Instructions to Review
- Read `packet_analysis_report.md` for analysis.
- Open `wireshark_capture.pcap` in Wireshark.
- View `Screenshots/` for visuals.
